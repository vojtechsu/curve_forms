## curve_forms

A collection of transformations between different curve forms (models). 
[curve_forms.md](curve_forms.md) contains an overview of all the supported transformations. Use `jupytext --from md --to ipynb curve_forms.md` to get an easy to use notebook. For each transformation, a simple python+[sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) implementation is given.


### curve_forms module

For more complex computations use the python+[sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) implementation in [lib]('lib').
